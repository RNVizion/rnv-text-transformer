RNV-WIRING-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

rnv-text-transformer: the image budget guards a file this repository does not have.

    python up.py             # rewrite the guard, run it, run the suites
    python up.py --check     # rehearse, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # re-run the suites against what is on disk
    python up.py --finish    # delete this script

WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHOSE FAULT IT IS. The image-budget round wrote one
guard and installed the same one in all five applications. Its budget carried

    ('resources/icons/special_slot.png', 512, 'a slot badge'),

and only two applications have that file -- the palette manager, where it is
the 99-or-more overflow tile drawn by PreviewGrid, and the mixer, where it is
an unused byte-for-byte duplicate of the app icon. Here it named nothing.

**Nothing is wrong with your images.** The resize ran and landed: the
background is 3840 on its long edge, the three gears and the icon are 512,
and the action buttons and screenshots were never touched. What failed is the
guard's own scope, on this test:

    test_the_budget_still_matches_real_files

which exists because a glob that matches nothing passes every other assertion
and looks exactly like a repository in good order. It was written against the
possibility of a budget going stale. The first thing it found was a budget
that had never been true here.

WHAT THIS DOES. Rewrites tests/test_image_budget.py with a budget that
describes THIS repository: background, three gears, icon. The entry is
removed rather than exempted -- a budget belongs to the repository it
governs, and an exemption would have left the rule in place with a note
explaining why it never applies, which is how a guard stops being read.

It also adds one test, stating the same failure from the other side: a budget
pattern with no wildcard is a claim that a specific path exists, so it is
checked as one. An assertion that names the missing FILE is easier to act on
than one that names a glob.

NO ASSET IS OPENED, RESIZED, MOVED OR WRITTEN. One test file changes.

GUARD_SOURCE = r'''"""RNV-IMAGE-BUDGET-GUARD -- the resources stay the size they were reduced to.

Installed 2026-09-08, scope corrected 2026-09-09. This repository shipped a
window background of 16000x9038 (or 8000x4500) and a settings gear of
3334x3334 for a button that renders at 50x50. Across the five applications
that was 537 MB of pixels reproducing, for the most part, flat geometric
shapes.

The backgrounds are now 3840 on the long edge -- a full 4K width, so a
maximised window on a 4K display still scales DOWN rather than up -- and the
oversized square assets are 512.

WHAT THIS GUARD IS FOR. Nothing about a resize sticks. The next export from a
design tool lands at whatever that tool defaults to, the file is committed
because it looks right, and the repository quietly grows back. A dimension is
checkable, so it is checked.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER. The action buttons and the screenshots.
The action buttons are already 0.2-0.4 MB and sized for the widgets they
fill -- a rule that squeezed their long edge would crush their short one,
which is how a 1250x146 button becomes 512x60 and looks wrong on a HiDPI
screen. The screenshots are 1920x1080 documentation. Neither is a problem, so
neither is governed here.
