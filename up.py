"""RNV-GOLD-HOVER — the main surface lights gold under the pointer.

    python up.py             # apply, then run the guard and both suites
    python up.py --check     # rehearse every edit in memory, write nothing

For rnv-text-transformer, derived against a fresh clone at the live head.

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it names what it retires. That marker is what tells
this fleet's scanners to skip it.

THE RULING. Every hover on the main surface takes the mode's gold —
BRAND_GOLD (#d2bc93) in dark and image, BRAND_DARK_GOLD (#8c7337) in light.
All five applications already define both under those names. The extras —
About, Settings, other dialogs — were always allowed gold; this extends the
same treatment to the surface, which the mixer's combo box already used it on.

IT WAS SETTLED BY A RENDER, after three readings of the source got it wrong
in the same way — a palette KEY read instead of the widget. The mixer's gold
`scrollbar_hover` is dialogs only. The transformer's `scrollbar_handle_hover`
key is dead while its text windows hover from `theme['accent']`. The icon
builder's zoom slider lives inside `settings_dialog.py`. What settled it was
drawing the control and reading the pixels that changed.

WHAT CHANGES HERE.

    The palette stops disagreeing with the window.

    utils/dialog_styles.py         scrollbar_handle_hover -> BRAND_GOLD
    utils/colors.py, utils/__init__.py   GREY_60, its provenance and exports
    tests/__snapshots__/…ambr      the dark palette snapshot
    tests/test_semantic_naming.py  GREY_60 joins RETIRED, and the guard
                                   learns the fleet's delivery marker

NOTHING VISIBLE CHANGES HERE, and that is the finding. This repository's
text windows have hovered gold all along -- `ui/main_window.py::_get_scrollbar_style`
paints them from `theme['accent']` -- while the palette key named for that
role held a grey no code ever read. The key now says what the window does.

It is one of the twenty-three keys in this fleet that no application code
reads. The key is kept, because the key-set parity lists in the test suites
require it, and whether it should exist at all is a separate question with
twenty-two others attached to it.

WHAT THIS ROUND DOES NOT INSTALL: a guard. What already exists covers it —
this repository's is named below and runs first — and in the mixer the three
regenerated stylesheet snapshots are the proof the gold renders.
