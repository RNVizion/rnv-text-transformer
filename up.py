RNV-STATUS-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

Re-walk rnv-text-transformer's light status text to the boundary the gold already stops at.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify

THIS IS A FOLLOW-UP, NOT A SECOND MIGRATION

The status family landed here against register rev 30. Rev 31, on 2026-09-05,
moved three values and nothing else -- the LIGHT text variants -- and closed
the question the migration scripts carried as RNV-STATUS-LIGHT-FLOOR.

    STATUS_SUCCESS_TEXT_LIGHT  #8a6581  ->  #825d79
    STATUS_WARNING_TEXT_LIGHT  #976633  ->  #8e5e2b
    STATUS_ERROR_TEXT_LIGHT    #b84e58  ->  #ae4650

Everything else the migration did is untouched. The fills, the dark text
variants and the two gamut-corrected reds are already at rev 31 and are
asserted here so this script cannot run against a repository that is not.


WHY THE VALUES MOVED

They were first walked against #f5f5f5, which the register's rule called "the
worst light ground". It was not: rev 27 had put APP hover-light #eeeeee,
GOLD_TEXT_GROUND_FLOOR #e8e8e8 and pressed-light #e0e0e0 below it, and because
the rule takes the FIRST step that clears, each value stopped at 4.52 with no
margin and they failed one rung down together.

THE DECIDING REASON IS NOT THE SIZE OF THE MOVE. The desktop side argued from
cost -- a small move, the same colours -- and that does not pick between
#e8e8e8 and #e0e0e0, because #e0e0e0 was affordable on identical grounds. The
register's reason does: #e8e8e8 is where BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP already stops.

    on #e8e8e8   gold-deep 4.53   the three 4.52 / 4.53 / 4.52   pass
    on #e0e0e0   gold-deep 4.21   the three 4.20 / 4.20 / 4.20   fail

ONE boundary for every brand text family instead of two. Walking to #e0e0e0
would have covered the pressed plate and left an author having to remember
which family they were in to know where text stops.


WHAT THIS ALSO DOES

The migration NARROWED a boundary test to #ffffff and #f5f5f5 while the
question was open, and recorded in the docstring what it had given up. This
restores the full four rungs -- and they pass, because the values reach them.
That is the point of the re-walk being visible in the test rather than only in
the register.


ONE THING IS STILL OPEN, ON THE OTHER SIDE

The DARK text variants have the identical fault. They were derived against APP
card #2a2a2a; rev 29 then registered panel-hover #3a3a3a, which is LIGHTER and
therefore worse for light text on a dark ground. All three fail there --
success-text 3.61, warning-text 3.64, error-text 3.58 -- while BRAND_GOLD
clears every dark surface at 6.15.

The register left it open because the fix is not symmetric: on light the worst
surface is a PRESSED plate and ruling that running text is not carried on a
transient state is defensible, while on dark the worst is a HOVER, which a
label sits under for as long as a cursor rests there.

The fleet's exposure today is ZERO. The element sweep across all five
applications resolves four status elements, every one a plain dialog label
painted with an inline `color:` on a dialog ground; no status key appears in a
selector carrying :hover, in any mode. This script does not touch the dark
values, and the guard it installs asserts them at their current numbers so a
future re-walk has to come through the register rather than by hand.
