For rnv-text-transformer, derived against a fresh clone at the live head (48555a8).

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it names what it retires. That marker is what tells
this fleet's scanners to skip it.

RULED 2026-09-25 (ruling 4): eight-digit hex falls under the register's
lower-case rule. with_alpha() wrote its alpha in upper case and the colour as given:
'#BF1a1a1a'. It writes '#bf1a1a1a' now, whatever case it is given. Three
image keys in each palette change spelling, and six snapshot lines with
them. Qt reads either case, so no pixel moves.
