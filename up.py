RNV-WIRING-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

rnv-text-transformer: make the test-tooling pins agree with the other four applications.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # re-run the suites against what is on disk
    python up.py --finish    # delete this script

WHAT WAS WRONG, AND IT IS ARITHMETIC RATHER THAN OPINION. Across the five
applications, two packages are declared with ranges that NO single version
satisfies:

    pytest       picker  ==9.0.2          icon builder  >=8.0.0,<9.0.0
    pytest-cov   picker  ==7.1.0          icon builder  >=5.0.0,<7.0.0

There is no version of pytest that is both exactly 9.0.2 and below 9.0.0.
So on one interpreter -- which is what a laptop is -- installing the
picker's dev requirements and then the icon builder's UNINSTALLS pytest 9
and installs pytest 8; going the other way undoes it. Every switch between
those two repositories rewrites site-packages, and the window while pip is
mid-swap is a partially-populated _pytest package. That is exactly the
shape of

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_pytest.compat'

appearing seconds after the same command had succeeded. No amount of care
about install order fixes it, because the constraint is unsatisfiable.

THE CAPS HAD NO EVIDENCE BEHIND THEM. The icon builder's `pytest<9.0.0` and
`pytest-cov<7.0.0` were tested rather than trusted. On pytest 9.1.1 with
pytest-cov 7.1.0 -- both past its own ceiling -- its suite passes 632 tests.
All five were run on the exact set these new ranges resolve to today:

    rnv-text-transformer        669 passed, 1 skipped
    rnv-color-picker           1452 passed, 4 skipped
    rnv-color-palette-manager   564 passed, 1 skipped
    rnv-color-mixer             723 passed, 14 skipped  + 355 locked
    rnv-icon-builder            632 passed, 2 skipped

WHAT THIS DOES. Rewrites 5 specifier(s) in 1 file(s) to the fleet
standard, identical in all five:

        pytest>=8.0,<10.0
        pytest-qt>=4.4,<5.0
        pytest-cov>=5.0,<8.0
        pytest-timeout>=2.4,<3.0
        pytest-benchmark>=4.0,<6.0

The floor of each is the highest floor any of the five already declared, so
no repository gives up ground. The ceiling is the next MAJOR version, which
is the thing the old caps were reaching for and the thing `==` cannot
express: nothing crosses a major boundary without someone editing a line.

WHY NOT `==`. An exact pin on a shared tool makes one repository fight the
other four every time anything moves. It belongs in a lock file, not in the
dev requirements of five applications developed together on one machine.

NO PACKAGE IS ADDED OR REMOVED. This repository declares exactly the
packages it declared before; only the specifiers change.

NO SOURCE FILE IS TOUCHED. No colour, no value, no behaviour.

their dev-tooling ranges have to be mutually satisfiable.

Installed 2026-09-07. Until today they were not, and it was arithmetic rather
than a matter of taste:

    pytest       picker  ==9.0.2      icon builder  >=8.0.0,<9.0.0
    pytest-cov   picker  ==7.1.0      icon builder  >=5.0.0,<7.0.0

No version of pytest is both exactly 9.0.2 and below 9.0.0. On a development
machine -- one interpreter, five checkouts -- installing one repository's dev
requirements and then the other's UNINSTALLS pytest 9 and installs pytest 8,
and going back undoes it. While pip is mid-swap the _pytest package on disk is
partially populated, which is where

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_pytest.compat'

comes from, seconds after the same command had just succeeded. No install
order avoids it. The constraint itself was impossible.

WHAT THIS FILE GUARDS. Four things, in the order they are likely to break:

  1. This repository's ranges are still the fleet's.
  2. Every file in this repository that declares them agrees with the others.
     Both pyproject.toml files in the fleet SAY IN A COMMENT that they mirror
     tests/requirements-dev.txt. Nothing checked it. Now something does.
  3. No exact `==` pin has come back. That is the mechanism, not the symptom:
     an exact pin on a shared tool makes one repository fight the other four
     every time anything moves.
  4. The pytest actually running this test satisfies what the file declares.
     Points 1 to 3 read files; this one looks at the machine, and it is the
     one that would have caught the failure that started all this.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. A test in this repository cannot see the other four. If
someone edits a range here, this fails here -- which is the point. If someone
edits it in all five identically, that is a fleet decision and this agrees
with it, as it should.
