RNV-GOLD-ALIGNMENT-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

Arm the other half of the gold rule in rnv-text-transformer.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse every edit in memory, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # run the suites only, change nothing
    python up.py --finish    # delete this file

NO APPLICATION CODE CHANGES. One test file is replaced with a longer version
of itself. Nothing fails the new check today, in this app or in any of the
other four -- which is the reason to add it now rather than the reason not to.

THE RULE IS BIDIRECTIONAL AND THE GUARD WAS NOT

rnv-brand rev 25 published it in both directions:

    On a light ground, gold as TEXT is BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP.
    Gold as a FILL or an EDGE is BRAND_DARK_GOLD.

The second sentence is not a stylistic preference, and the arithmetic is not
symmetric:

    text on #f5f5f5    BRAND_DARK_GOLD 4.1670 FAIL   DEEP 5.0949 pass
    text on #eeeeee    BRAND_DARK_GOLD 3.9156 FAIL   DEEP 4.7875 pass
    fill, black on it  BRAND_DARK_GOLD 4.6226 pass   DEEP 3.7806 FAIL

BRAND_DARK_GOLD carries text on pure white and on nothing else these apps use
as a surface. BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP carries text everywhere and cannot be sat
on. A sweep that read the rule as "prefer DEEP" and replaced every
BRAND_DARK_GOLD would have fixed the text sites and broken the fills -- six of
the sites corrected across these repositories this week are fills and edges.

WHAT WAS ALREADY CHECKED, BY HAND

Every gold fill in all five apps, with the label drawn on it:

    rnv-text-transformer        4 sites   #ffffff throughout       5.5547
    rnv-color-picker            4 sites   inherited white          5.5547
    rnv-icon-builder            1 site    checkbox indicator, no text
    rnv-color-mixer             1 site    checkbox indicator, no text
    rnv-color-palette-manager   0 sites

Ten sites, zero failures. In this app: 4 sites — item hovers in combo, table, list and tree, all carrying #ffffff at 5.5547.

WHY ADD A GUARD THAT PASSES

Because this is the only moment it is cheap. A guard proposed against a live
defect writes itself; a guard proposed against a clean sweep has to be argued
for, and the argument gets weaker every month the sweep stays clean. The
text direction was clean-looking too until somebody resolved the declarations
through the palettes, and then it was seven defects in three applications.

READING A FILL IS HARDER THAN READING TEXT, AND THE GUARD SAYS SO

Six of those ten sites declare no colour of their own -- a
`QPushButton:hover` that sets only a background takes its label from the base
`QPushButton` rule. The new sweep reads that enclosing rule rather than
guessing, and skips a site where it can find no label at all rather than
assuming one. A rule with no text (a checkbox indicator, a progress chunk)
is counted as unresolved, not as a pass.

And it carries a companion: test_the_fill_sweep_still_finds_things. A sweep
over a clean codebase and a sweep that resolves nothing file the same report,
and that assertion is the only thing that distinguishes them.

GUARD_SOURCE = '"""Gold drawn as TEXT must clear the text floor on the ground it is drawn on.\n\nWHY THIS EXISTS. The gold family has two members that look interchangeable and\nare not. BRAND_DARK_GOLD #8c7337 fills and bounds correctly on light surfaces\nand FAILS as text on them; BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP #7e6529 is the derivative that\nexists for text, and the palettes name it `accent_ink` -- "Accent when it\ncarries text". In DARK MODE THE TWO ARE THE SAME VALUE, so every check written\nwhere they coincide is blind to the case where they diverge, and that is\nexactly what happened: gold-as-text sites shipped in light mode at 3.71 and\n4.17 against a 4.5 floor, in more than one application, for as long as the\ndialogs have existed.\n\nWHAT IT DOES. Reads every f-string in the source, pulls `color:` and\n`background-color:` out of each QSS rule, resolves the placeholders through\nthis app\'s own palettes, and measures. A declaration whose foreground is a\ngold-family value and whose contrast falls below the floor fails.\n\nWHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated because a sweep that reports only what it found\nlooks identical to one that found nothing:\n\n  - a placeholder that is not a palette lookup, a module constant or a local\n    bound to one is UNRESOLVED and skipped\n  - a rule with no background-color of its own INHERITS, and the ground is\n    taken from the palette\'s window or panel value, which is a guess\n\nBoth counts are asserted rather than printed: if the resolved count collapses,\nthe sweep has gone blind and says so instead of passing.\n\nREADING THE MODE. A block written inside `if self._is_dark:` and bound with\n`_d = ThemeManager.DARK_THEME` is dark-only, and scoring it against the light\npalette invents a pairing that never renders.
