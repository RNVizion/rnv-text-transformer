RNV-WIRING-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

rnv-text-transformer: bring the oversized resources down to the size anything renders them.

    python up.py             # resize, install the guard, run the suites
    python up.py --check     # rehearse every resize in memory, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # re-run the suites against what is on disk
    python up.py --finish    # delete this script

WHAT IS OVERSIZED, MEASURED ACROSS THE FIVE APPLICATIONS.

    background.png          16000x9038 (or 8000x4500)   ~100 MB
    settings_gear_*.png     3334x3334, for a 50x50 button
    icon.png                2134x2134, for a window icon

537 MB of pixels across the fleet, storing -- for the most part -- flat
geometric shapes. The mixer spends **2.18 seconds decoding its background on
every launch**; at 3840 that is 0.18 s.

    background   ->  3840 on the long edge   ~10.6 MB   (a full 4K width)
    gear + icon  ->  512

WHY 3840 AND NOT SMALLER. It is a full 4K width, so a maximised window on a
4K display still scales the image DOWN rather than up. 2560 is visually
identical on every display anyone here has, and would have been half the
size; 3840 is the number that needs no argument.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE. Every action button and every screenshot.
The action buttons are already 0.2-0.4 MB and sized for the widgets they
fill: a rule that squeezed the long edge would crush the short one, turning a
1250x146 button into 512x60 -- the right file size and the wrong picture on a
HiDPI screen. The screenshots are 1920x1080 documentation.

NOTHING MOVES. Every file is rewritten where it stands. This project's
standing instruction is that the image directories are correct and are not to
be rearranged, and a resize that also relocated a file would be a much larger
change wearing a smaller one's clothes.

NO COLOUR IS AT RISK. The background is decorative: config.py tests it for
existence and uses it as a window pixmap. **It is never sampled for colour.**
That was the one thing that could have made this dangerous in a colour
application, so it was checked rather than assumed.

IDEMPOTENT. An asset already within budget is skipped, so running this twice
is safe and running it on a partly-done tree finishes the job.

Installed 2026-09-08. This repository shipped a window background of
16000x9038 (or 8000x4500) and a settings gear of 3334x3334 for a button that
renders at 50x50. Across the five applications that was 537 MB of pixels
reproducing, for the most part, flat geometric shapes.

The backgrounds are now 3840 on the long edge -- a full 4K width, so a
maximised window on a 4K display still scales DOWN rather than up -- and the
oversized square assets are 512.

WHAT THIS GUARD IS FOR. Nothing about a resize sticks. The next export from a
design tool lands at whatever that tool defaults to, the file is committed
because it looks right, and the repository quietly grows back. A dimension is
checkable, so it is checked.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER. The action buttons and the screenshots.
The action buttons are already 0.2-0.4 MB and sized for the widgets they
fill -- a rule that squeezed their long edge would crush their short one,
which is how a 1250x146 button becomes 512x60 and looks wrong on a HiDPI
screen. The screenshots are 1920x1080 documentation. Neither is a problem, so
neither is governed here.
