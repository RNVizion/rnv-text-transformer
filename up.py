"""RNV-NO-VACUOUS-TESTS — a test that cannot fail is not a test.

    python up.py             # apply, then run the guard and both suites
    python up.py --check     # rehearse every edit in memory, write nothing

For rnv-text-transformer, derived against a fresh clone at the live head.

WHY THIS EXISTS HERE. The rule was written for rnv-color-mixer, where one
assertion in tests/ could not fail:

    assert result is not None or True

It sat in a test that had never run — it called a function that does not
exist, caught the AttributeError, and turned it into a permanent
`pytest.skip("not in this version")`. A specification reported as a skip
reads, in a summary line, exactly like coverage.

Then the same sweep was run across the whole fleet: **5,667 test functions
in five applications**. This is what it found here.

    nothing to fix

WHAT THE GUARD ENFORCES: no assertion true regardless of the code; no test
body that is only `pass`; no test that can never fail (no assertion AND
every statement swallowed); no test that skips itself on AttributeError.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT: forbid a test having no assertion. Hundreds
of those across this fleet are legitimate — they are named `..._no_crash`
and they fail if the call raises. A rule against them would be noise that
gets suppressed, which is worse than no rule.

THE GUARD IS IDENTICAL IN ALL FIVE CHECKOUTS, AND THAT COST TWO MISTAKES.
Its first version swept `tests/` only and asserted at least 500 test
functions. Ported unchanged it would have landed **red** in the palette
manager, which has 443 under tests/, and **blind** in the same repository,
whose snapshots/ directory holds six more tests it would never have read.
Both were numbers and paths taken from the repository it was written in. It
now discovers what to read — every `test_*.py` except the ones at the
repository root, where each application keeps its locked suite — and its
floor is structural: at least twenty files, and at least as many test
functions as files.

THE LOCKED SUITE IS EXCLUDED EVERYWHERE, by ownership rather than by
quality. In the mixer it is where every remaining instance lives: all 13
`except Exception: pass` handlers and all 3 tests that can never fail.

GUARD_SOURCE = r'''"""RNV-NO-VACUOUS-TESTS-GUARD -- a test that cannot fail is not a test.

Installed 2026-09-10, after a sweep of all 1,049 test functions in the
repository.

WHAT THE SWEEP FOUND, AND WHAT IT DID NOT. The honest headline first: this
suite is in good shape. Across 51 files there was exactly **one** assertion
in tests/ that could not fail, no empty test bodies, and every one of the 94
tests without an assertion turned out to be a deliberate smoke test -- they
are named `..._no_crash` and `..._does_not_crash`, and they fail if the call
raises, which is the whole point of them. Those are not defects and this
guard does not touch them.

THE ONE. tests/test_app_event_handlers.py held

    result = FileUtils.detect_palette_format(ext)
    assert result is not None or True   # Some impls return None

`x or True` is true whatever x is. The assertion could not fail. Worse, it
never ran: `FileUtils.detect_palette_format` does not exist and never has,
so the call raised AttributeError, which the test caught and turned into
`pytest.skip("detect_palette_format not in this version")`. A permanent
skip, a wrong reason, and an assertion that was inert anyway. Its `expected`
column was never compared with anything either.

TWO MORE OF THE SAME FAMILY went with it. `get_palette_format_filter` names
a function that exists nowhere in the codebase, and
`safe_execute(default=)` a parameter that has never existed -- and whose
test claimed in its docstring that "some callers pass `default=`" when none
do. Both skipped themselves permanently. A specification reported as a skip
reads, in a summary line, exactly like coverage.

WHAT THIS GUARD ENFORCES, over tests/ only:

  * no assertion that is true regardless of the code under test;
  * no test whose body is only `pass`;
  * no test that can never fail -- no assertion of any kind AND every
    statement wrapped in a `try` whose handler is a bare `pass`.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ENFORCE. A test with no assertion is fine on
its own: `def test_set_theme_does_not_crash` asserts by not raising. Ninety
of those are legitimate here and a rule against them would be noise that
gets suppressed, which is worse than no rule.

THIS GUARD IS FLEET-PORTABLE, AND THAT COST TWO REPO-SPECIFIC MISTAKES.
The first version swept `tests/` only and asserted at least 500 test
functions. Ported unchanged it would have landed RED in the palette
manager, which has 443 under tests/, and BLIND in the same repo, whose
snapshots/ directory holds six more tests the sweep would never have read.
Both were numbers and paths taken from the repository it was written in.

It now discovers what to read: every `test_*.py` anywhere in the checkout
except the repository ROOT, where each application keeps its one locked
suite. The floor is structural rather than magic -- at least twenty files,
and at least as many test functions as files, since a test file with no
tests in it means the walk has gone blind.

THE LOCKED SUITE IS EXCLUDED, AND IN THE MIXER IT IS WHERE THE PROBLEM
ACTUALLY IS. test_rnv_color_mixer.py holds all 13 `except Exception: pass`
handlers in that repository and all 3 tests that can never fail:

    test_handle_exception_no_crash          (line 1177)
    test_set_autosave_interval_no_crash     (line 1482)
    test_load_settings_no_crash             (line 1545)

Each has no assertion and swallows everything it calls. Two others in that
file call `FileUtils.auto_detect_and_import_palette` on the class with one
argument, so both raise TypeError before reaching the function and both
swallow it -- documented in tests/test_palette_import.py.

That file is locked by convention, so this round reports rather than edits.
The exclusion is a statement about ownership, not about quality: those
tests are the ones worth fixing.
