THIS IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE PYTEST ROUND. That round fixed the one
conflict that was actively breaking: pytest==9.0.2 against pytest<9.0.0, no
version satisfying both, site-packages rewritten on every switch between two
repositories. This one fixes the same CLASS of defect everywhere else it
appears, before any of it costs anybody a morning.

Three findings, all measured across the five rather than assumed.

1. SIX PLACES WHERE ONE REPOSITORY DISAGREES WITH ITSELF.

       transformer  chardet    pyproject >=5.0.0        requirements >=5.2.0
       transformer  watchdog   pyproject >=3.0.0        requirements >=4.0.0
       mixer        Pillow     pyproject >=9.0.0,<12.0  requirements >=10.0
       mixer        PyQt6      pyproject >=6.5.0,<7.0.0 requirements >=6.5
       palette mgr  Pillow     pyproject >=10.0.0,<12.0 requirements >=10.0.0
       palette mgr  PyQt6      pyproject >=6.5.0,<7.0   requirements >=6.5.0

   Whichever file you install from wins, and which one that is depends on
   the command somebody typed. Both pyproject files in the fleet carry a
   comment SAYING they mirror the requirements. Nothing checked it.

2. TWO EXACT PINS LEFT, both in rnv-color-picker: PyQt6==6.10.2 and
   hypothesis==6.152.4. Currently satisfiable, so nothing is breaking today
   -- but it is the identical mechanism to pytest==9.0.2, one release away
   from doing the identical thing on a much heavier package. Each becomes a
   range whose FLOOR is the version it was pinned to, because that is the
   version this application is known to work on and a lower floor would be
   a claim nothing has tested.

3. PILLOW'S `<12.0` CAP EXCLUDED THE API THE FLEET JUST ADOPTED.
   `get_flattened_data` arrived in Pillow 12.1. utils/pil_compat.py was
   installed to prefer it. The cap meant the pyproject install path could
   never reach it -- and the cap has to move before 2027-10-15 regardless,
   because that is the day Pillow 14 removes `getdata()`.

   All five suites were run on Pillow 12.2.0 before this change. Lifted to
   `<13.0`, fleet-wide and identical in all five: past the version that
   matters, still short of a major boundary nobody has tested.

WHAT THIS DOES HERE. Rewrites 4 specifier(s) in 2 file(s).

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. No package is added or removed. No floor is lowered.
No source file is touched. The test-tooling ranges are governed separately
by tests/test_test_tooling_pins.py and are not in scope here.

STILL OPEN, AND NOT DECIDED BY THIS SCRIPT: rnv-text-transformer and
rnv-icon-builder declare PyQt6 with no upper bound at all, while the mixer
and the palette manager cap it below 7.0. That asymmetry is reported rather
than fixed -- adding a ceiling to a runtime dependency is a decision about
what an application claims to support, and it is not a delivery script's to
make.

Installed 2026-09-07, as the second half of the pytest round. That round
fixed the conflict that was actively breaking:

    pytest       picker  ==9.0.2      icon builder  >=8.0.0,<9.0.0

No version is both. On one interpreter, pip rewrote site-packages on every
switch between those two repositories, and a half-rewritten _pytest package
is where `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_pytest.compat'` came from.

This file guards the same CLASS of defect in the packages that had not yet
bitten -- and one of them is PyQt6, where it would have cost a great deal
more than a morning.

WHAT THIS FILE GUARDS.

  1. Two files in this repository do not declare different ranges for the
     same package. Six such disagreements existed across the fleet. Both
     pyproject.toml files in it carry a comment SAYING they mirror the
     requirements; a comment is a promise, and this is the part that keeps
     it. Whichever file you install from wins, and which one that is
     depends on the command somebody happened to type.
  2. No exact `==` pin. Two were left -- PyQt6==6.10.2 and
     hypothesis==6.152.4, both in rnv-color-picker. Neither was breaking
     anything, which is the point: neither was pytest==9.0.2 either, until
     the day another repository disagreed with it.
  3. Pillow matches the range all five share. It is the one package with a
     DATED deadline behind it: the old pixel-access method is removed in
     Pillow 14 on 2027-10-15, and `get_flattened_data` -- the replacement
     that utils/pil_compat.py prefers -- arrived in Pillow 12.1. The old
     `<12.0` cap excluded it.

     (Named indirectly on purpose. tests/test_pil_compat.py sweeps every
     file for the retired call and this one is not exempt from that sweep,
     so writing the call form here -- even in prose -- fails it. Use versus
     mention, and this file was the tenth instance in this programme.)
  4. What is installed satisfies what is declared. Everything above reads
     text; this one looks at the machine, and it is the shape of check that
     would have caught the failure that started all this.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.

  It does not require every range to have a ceiling, and it does not require
  the five to agree on floors other than Pillow's. Applications legitimately
  support different minimum versions of the same library. What they may not
  do is contradict themselves, pin exactly, or make a version no combination
  can satisfy.

  The test-tooling packages are excluded here. They have a fleet standard of
  their own and their own guard, tests/test_test_tooling_pins.py, because a
  tool five repositories run on one interpreter is a different question from
  a library one application imports.

comes and goes, this change is not involved.
