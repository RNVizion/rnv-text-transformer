RNV-WIRING-TOOL-DO-NOT-SWEEP

rnv-text-transformer: pin the brand register, so the checks that compare this application
to it stop skipping.

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # re-run the suites against what is on disk
    python up.py --finish    # delete this script

WHAT WAS WRONG. This repository keeps a hand-written PINNED mirror of
rnv-brand's values, and about five tests compare that mirror against the real
register. Every one of them is guarded with

    pytest.importorskip('engine.brand')

and rnv-brand shipped no pyproject.toml, so it was not installable, so they
all skipped. Across the five applications that is 22 checks, skipped on every
run since they were written. **A mirror that nothing compares against is a
copy, and a copy drifts.**

It had already drifted. Putting the register on the path for the first time
made rnv-text-transformer fail immediately: two constants classified as
app-owned that the register had owned since rev 27, four revisions earlier,
with nothing to say so.

WHAT THIS DOES. One line in tests/requirements-dev.txt, pinning rnv-brand to
commit b4fa970. **No workflow changes** -- every workflow in this repository
already installs that file, which is why this round touches no YAML.

PINNED TO A COMMIT, NOT A BRANCH. The pin is the written statement of which
revision of the brand this application mirrors. A branch ref moves on its
own: the register could change between two runs of the same commit here, and
the first anyone would know is a failure on a build that changed nothing. A
sha cannot do that -- moving it is an edit, and an edit is reviewable.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. The importorskip calls stay exactly as they are. They
are right for a developer who has not installed the dev dependencies, and
rewriting 22 of them across five repositories would be churn with a real
chance of error. Instead the ABSENCE is made loud in one place: if the
register is missing, one test fails and explains what it means, instead of
twenty-two quietly not running. A skipped test and a passing test look the
same in a summary line, and that is the whole failure mode.

NO SOURCE FILE IS TOUCHED. No colour, no value, no behaviour.

mirror against the real register was guarded with

    pytest.importorskip('engine.brand')

rnv-brand shipped no pyproject.toml, so it was not installable, so those
checks skipped -- in all five applications, 22 of them, every run. A mirror
that nothing compares against is a copy, and a copy drifts. It had already
drifted: rnv-text-transformer classified two values as app-owned that the
register had owned since rev 27, and nothing said so for four revisions.

rnv-brand is now packaged and pinned in tests/requirements-dev.txt, which
every workflow in this repository already installs. The checks run.

WHAT THIS FILE ADDS. The importorskip calls are left exactly as they are --
they are correct for a developer who has not installed the dev dependencies,
