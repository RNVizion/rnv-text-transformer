rnv-text-transformer: four resolver fixes for the gold-as-text guard

    python up.py             # apply, then verify
    python up.py --check     # rehearse, write nothing
    python up.py --verify    # re-run the suites against what is on disk
    python up.py --finish    # delete this script

WHAT THE GUARD DOES. It reads every f-string in the source, pulls `color:` and
`background-color:` out of each QSS rule, resolves the placeholders through
this application's own palettes, and measures. Gold drawn as TEXT below 4.5 on
its ground fails; a label on a gold FILL below 4.5 fails. It has run in three
of the five applications since the gold alignment round.

FOUR RESOLVER DEFECTS, FOUND BY PORTING IT. rnv-color-palette-manager builds
its two dialog stylesheets in two separate functions -- _get_style_dark() and
_get_style_light() -- where the other applications use one function with an
if/else. That difference exposed four blind spots that had been in the sweep
since it was written:

  1. THE MODULE SCOPE CLAIMED EVERY F-STRING. `ast.walk` yields the Module
     before the functions inside it, and walking the Module collects
     assignments from every function in the file -- last one wins. So the dark
     block's `pressed_text = TRUE_BLACK` resolved as the light block's
     `pressed_text = WHITE`, and the sweep reported white-on-gold at 1.85 in
     DARK: a pairing that cannot render. Scopes are now sorted deepest first.

  2. AN ALIASED IMPORT IS A BINDING. That application binds its palette with a
     lazy `from ui.colors import LIGHT_THEME_COLORS as colors` inside each
     function, to break a circular import. Only Assign was read, so the mode
     marker -- which was sitting on the import line -- was invisible, the mode
     reader fell back to all three modes, and a light-only stylesheet was
     scored against the dark palette.

  3. THE TWO READERS DISAGREED. The value resolver expanded a bare local
     through the bindings; the mode reader did not, and returned all modes for
     anything that was not literally a subscript. The value then came from one
     palette and the mode from another.

  4. A DECLARED COLOUR THAT CANNOT BE PARSED IS NOT AN ABSENT ONE. The pressed
     gold button is written `color: {WHITE if is_light else TRUE_BLACK}` --
     correct in both modes, 6.03:1 in dark. The resolver does not read
     conditionals, returned None, and the code fell through to the CONTAINER
     rule's label, reporting black text as #dddddd at 1.36 in two files.
     Inheriting is only right where the rule declares nothing.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE THREE THAT ALREADY HAD IT. All three were re-run with
the fixed sweep and all three are still clean -- the blind spots were hiding
nothing here. They would have started hiding things the first time a
stylesheet was split into two functions, which is a refactor nobody would
think to check a contrast guard against.

NO SOURCE FILE IS TOUCHED except for one pointer comment. This round changes
what is checked, not what is painted.

GUARD_SOURCE = r'''"""Gold drawn as TEXT must clear the text floor on the ground it is drawn on.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The gold family has two members that look interchangeable and
are not. BRAND_DARK_GOLD #8c7337 fills and bounds correctly on light surfaces
and FAILS as text on them; BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP #7e6529 is the derivative that
exists for text, and the palettes name it `accent_ink` -- "Accent when it
carries text". In DARK MODE THE TWO ARE THE SAME VALUE, so every check written
where they coincide is blind to the case where they diverge, and that is
exactly what happened: gold-as-text sites shipped in light mode at 3.71 and
4.17 against a 4.5 floor, in more than one application, for as long as the
dialogs have existed.

WHAT IT DOES. Reads every f-string in the source, pulls `color:` and
`background-color:` out of each QSS rule, resolves the placeholders through
this app's own palettes, and measures. A declaration whose foreground is a
gold-family value and whose contrast falls below the floor fails.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated because a sweep that reports only what it found
looks identical to one that found nothing:

  - a placeholder that is not a palette lookup, a module constant or a local
    bound to one is UNRESOLVED and skipped
  - a rule with no background-color of its own INHERITS, and the ground is
    taken from the palette's window or panel value, which is a guess

Both counts are asserted rather than printed: if the resolved count collapses,
the sweep has gone blind and says so instead of passing.

READING THE MODE. A block written inside `if self._is_dark:` and bound with
`_d = ThemeManager.DARK_THEME` is dark-only, and scoring it against the light
palette invents a pairing that never renders. Declarations are restricted to
the mode their variable came from. The first version of this sweep, without
that, reported five impossible failures including gold on #333333 at 2.78.
