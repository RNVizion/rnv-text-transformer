For rnv-text-transformer, derived against a fresh clone at the live head.

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it quotes the code it replaces. That marker is what
tells the brand scanners in this fleet to skip it — installed by this same
round, so it takes effect in the run that installs it.

WHAT THE FLEET LOOKED LIKE. Five applications, one developer, one machine,
and five different answers to "what Python does this run on":

    repo              requires-python   CI ran                  classifiers
    mixer             >=3.10            3.11 only               3.10-3.13
    picker            >=3.13            3.13                    3.13
    palette manager   >=3.13            3.13                    3.13
    text transformer  >=3.10            3.13 only               3.10-3.13
    icon builder      >=3.10            3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13     3.10-3.13

Three declared support for 3.10 and never ran it. The palette manager
declared 3.13 and meant it — seven of its files use PEP 695 `type X = ...`,
which 3.11 cannot parse, so its suite does not even COLLECT on the floor
three of its siblings were claiming.

A declared floor nobody runs is the same shape as a deselect nobody reads:
an exemption with no subject. It looks like support and is not.

WHAT THIS REPOSITORY NEEDED.

    The repository where the code already knew the answer and the constants did
not. `MIN_PYTHON_VERSION = (3, 10)` sat directly above an error message
reading "Python 3.13+ recommended for best performance", and ruff was
targeting py310 with `UP` (pyupgrade) selected -- which tells the linter to
rewrite modern syntax BACKWARDS.

    pyproject.toml           >=3.10 -> >=3.13, PyQt6 capped below 7.0,
                             four classifiers -> one, mypy 3.10 -> 3.13,
                             ruff py310 -> py313
    requirements.txt         PyQt6>=6.6.0 -> PyQt6>=6.6.0,<7.0
    RNV_Text_Transformer.py  MIN_PYTHON_VERSION (3, 10) -> (3, 13), and the
                             message now says required rather than recommended

PyQt6 WAS DECLARED TWICE, and capping requirements.txt alone would have left
pyproject.toml uncapped. Caught by this round's own guard on its first run
against a half-applied fix. No scanner change here: this is the one
repository with nothing that sweeps delivery scripts.

THE FLEET IS NOW 3.13 EVERYWHERE, declared and run, PyQt6 capped below 7.0
in all five, and pytest-timeout declared in all five. tests/test_fleet_floor.py
is the guard; it is byte-identical in every checkout and reads pyproject.toml
as TOML rather than sweeping it as text, because `version = "3.3.13"` and
`scikit-learn>=1.3.0` both match a regex for a Python version and neither is
one.

GUARD_SOURCE = r'''"""RNV-FLEET-FLOOR-GUARD -- one interpreter and one ceiling, fleet-wide.

Installed 2026-09-11, after a survey found the fleet stating its Python floor
three different ways and disagreeing with itself in four repositories out of
five.

WHAT WAS THERE. Three separate statements, none of them agreeing:

    repo              requires-python   CI ran
    mixer             >=3.10            3.11 only
    picker            >=3.13            3.13
    palette manager   >=3.13            3.13
    text transformer  >=3.10            3.13 only
    icon builder      >=3.10            3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

Three declared support for 3.10 and never ran it. The palette manager
declared 3.13 and meant it -- seven of its files use PEP 695
`type X = ...`, which 3.11 cannot parse, so its entire suite fails to
collect on the floor three of its siblings claimed. The icon builder was the
only one whose declaration matched what it tested, and it paid for that in
`ui/theme_manager.py`, which carried a note explaining it avoided PEP 695
"so the module imports on Python 3.10 and 3.11".

A declared floor nobody runs is the same shape as a deselect nobody reads:
an exemption with no subject. It looks like support and is not.

WHAT IS TRUE NOW. Every repository declares `requires-python >= 3.13` and
every CI job runs 3.13. Measured before shipping, under a real 3.13 with
PyQt6 6.11: the mixer -- the one repository that had never run on 3.13 --
passes 795 + 356, identical to its 3.11 numbers, and the icon builder passes
649 with `type ThemeDict = dict[str, str]` in place of the note.

THE SECOND PASS, AND WHY THERE HAD TO BE ONE. The first sweep read
`requires-python` and the CI matrices, fixed both, and called the fleet
consistent. It was not. Asked instead what ELSE in pyproject.toml names a
Python version, three more statements came out:

    repo              classifiers            mypy      ruff
    mixer             3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13    "3.10"    --
    picker            3.13                   --        --
    palette manager   3.13                   --        --
    text transformer  3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13    "3.10"    "py310"
    icon builder      3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13    --        --

Classifiers are what the package advertises publicly; three repositories
were advertising support for three versions they had just stopped running.
The text transformer's ruff target was live behaviour rather than
decoration -- with `UP` (pyupgrade) selected, `py310` tells the linter to
rewrite modern syntax BACKWARDS, in the one repository whose runtime check
this round moved to 3.13.

Picker and palette manager needed no edit: they already listed 3.13 alone.
The fix everywhere else is what those two already do.

A RULE THAT WAS TRIED AND REMOVED. A fourth check flagged comments
mentioning Python 3.10 or 3.11 next to words like "import" or "support". As
a SURVEY it earned its place: it found the icon builder's PEP 695 note and,
in the text transformer, `MIN_PYTHON_VERSION = (3, 10)` sitting above an
error message that already called 3.13 "recommended" -- the code knew the
answer and the constant did not. Both are fixed.

As a standing guard it was useless, because it cannot tell a live
constraint from a record of one. The comments written to EXPLAIN each fix
mention the old versions, so the rule failed on its own repairs in both
repositories. A rule that fires on the note explaining why it no longer
applies is noise, and noise is what gets suppressed.

TWO MORE RULES LIVE HERE, AND IT IS WORTH SAYING WHY. This repository
already has `tests/test_dependency_coherence.py` (runtime packages) and
`tests/test_test_tooling_pins.py` (dev packages), both byte-identical across
the fleet. Neither has a rule of the kind added here: coherence checks that
a repository does not contradict ITSELF and that nothing is pinned exactly;
tooling-pins checks that declared RANGES match the fleet's. Neither asks
whether a ceiling exists, or whether a package is declared at all.

So the PyQt6 ceiling and pytest-timeout's presence are checked here rather
than bolted onto files that would then be answering a different question.
One round's decisions, enforced in one place. If either of those guards ever
grows a rule of this kind, this is the file to fold into it.

WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT DO. It does not check what interpreter is running
it. Pinning that would make the guard fail on a developer's machine for a
reason that is not a defect; CI is where the floor is enforced, and CI is
what this reads.
