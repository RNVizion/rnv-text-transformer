"""RNV-IMAGE-BUDGET-GUARD -- the resources stay the size they were reduced to.

Installed 2026-09-08, scope corrected 2026-09-09. This repository shipped a
window background of 16000x9038 (or 8000x4500) and a settings gear of
3334x3334 for a button that renders at 50x50. Across the five applications
that was 537 MB of pixels reproducing, for the most part, flat geometric
shapes.

The backgrounds are now 3840 on the long edge -- a full 4K width, so a
maximised window on a 4K display still scales DOWN rather than up -- and the
oversized square assets are 512.

WHAT THIS GUARD IS FOR. Nothing about a resize sticks. The next export from a
design tool lands at whatever that tool defaults to, the file is committed
because it looks right, and the repository quietly grows back. A dimension is
checkable, so it is checked.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER. The action buttons and the screenshots.
The action buttons are already 0.2-0.4 MB and sized for the widgets they
fill -- a rule that squeezed their long edge would crush their short one,
which is how a 1250x146 button becomes 512x60 and looks wrong on a HiDPI
screen. The screenshots are 1920x1080 documentation. Neither is a problem, so
neither is governed here.

#: RNV-IMAGE-BUDGET-SCOPE, 2026-09-09. The first version of this file was
#: written once and installed in all five applications, and it carried an
#: entry for resources/icons/special_slot.png. Only two applications have
#: that file: the palette manager, where it is the 99-or-more overflow tile
#: in PreviewGrid, and the mixer, where it is an unused duplicate of the app
#: icon. In the other three the entry was a rule with no subject, and
#: test_the_budget_still_matches_real_files -- which exists for exactly that
#: failure -- caught it on the first run. The entry is gone rather than
#: exempted. A budget belongs to the repository it governs.
