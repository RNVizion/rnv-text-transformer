"""RNV-STATUS-LIGHT-REWALK -- the light boundary is #e8e8e8, and it is shared.

Installed by the rev 31 follow-up. Two things it pins that the migration's own
guard does not:

  * the light text variants reach #e8e8e8, which they did not at rev 30;
  * they stop at #e0e0e0, and so does BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP -- one boundary for
    every brand text family rather than one per family.

The second is the load-bearing half. A test that only asserted "these clear
#e8e8e8" would pass equally on values walked to #e0e0e0, which is the choice
the register explicitly did not make.
