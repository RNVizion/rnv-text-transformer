"""Gold drawn as TEXT must clear the text floor on the ground it is drawn on.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The gold family has two members that look interchangeable and
are not. BRAND_DARK_GOLD #8c7337 fills and bounds correctly on light surfaces
and FAILS as text on them; BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP #7e6529 is the derivative that
exists for text, and the palettes name it `accent_ink` -- "Accent when it
carries text". In DARK MODE THE TWO ARE THE SAME VALUE, so every check written
where they coincide is blind to the case where they diverge, and that is
exactly what happened: gold-as-text sites shipped in light mode at 3.71 and
4.17 against a 4.5 floor, in more than one application, for as long as the
dialogs have existed.

WHAT IT DOES. Reads every f-string in the source, pulls `color:` and
`background-color:` out of each QSS rule, resolves the placeholders through
this app's own palettes, and measures. A declaration whose foreground is a
gold-family value and whose contrast falls below the floor fails.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated because a sweep that reports only what it found
looks identical to one that found nothing:

  - a placeholder that is not a palette lookup, a module constant or a local
    bound to one is UNRESOLVED and skipped
  - a rule with no background-color of its own INHERITS, and the ground is
    taken from the palette's window or panel value, which is a guess

Both counts are asserted rather than printed: if the resolved count collapses,
the sweep has gone blind and says so instead of passing.

READING THE MODE. A block written inside `if self._is_dark:` and bound with
`_d = ThemeManager.DARK_THEME` is dark-only, and scoring it against the light
palette invents a pairing that never renders. Declarations are restricted to
the mode their variable came from. The first version of this sweep, without
that, reported five impossible failures including gold on #333333 at 2.78.

    rnv-brand rev 25 publishes it bidirectionally:

        On a light ground, gold as TEXT is BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP.
        Gold as a FILL or an EDGE is BRAND_DARK_GOLD.

    The second sentence is not politeness. BRAND_DARK_GOLD_DEEP is derived for
    text and FAILS the fill job -- black on it reads 3.7806 against a 4.5
    floor, where BRAND_DARK_GOLD reads 4.6226. So a sweep that replaced every
    BRAND_DARK_GOLD with the derivative, reading the rule as "prefer DEEP",
    would fix the text sites and break the fills.

    Nothing fails this today, in any of the five applications. That is the
    reason to arm it now: a guard proposed against a live defect writes
    itself, and a guard proposed against a clean sweep gets harder to justify
    every month the sweep stays clean.
